# gVisor-supported Linux/arm64 syscalls

> [!NOTE] This list has been copied as-is from corresponding gVisor's release

This table is a reference of linux syscalls for the arm64 architecture and their compatibility
status in gVisor. gVisor does not support all syscalls and some syscalls may have a partial
implementation. However, note that a syscall not being implemented in gVisor does **not** imply that
applications using it will not work. Most language runtimes and libraries that call a syscall marked
as unimplemented in this table have fallback code to use an alternative syscall that _is_ supported
in gVisor.

This page is automatically generated from the source code.

Of 293 syscalls, 237 syscalls have a full or partial implementation. There are currently 56
unsupported syscalls.
