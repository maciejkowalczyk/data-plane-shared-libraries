# Roma V8 UDF Benchmarking

## Overview

The Roma Benchmark CLI tool provides functionality for User Defined Function (UDF) developers to
benchmark their code. It executes the UDF within the Roma BYOB execution environment, providing
additional visibility to help developers better understand the runtime cost of their UDF.
Load and execute are independently benchmarked, in the `BM_Load` and `BM_Execute` benchmarks
respectively. The tool uses the google microbenchmarking library and supports the standard set of
benchmarking flags, such as `--benchmark_time_unit` and `--benchmark_filter`. In addition to the
benchmarking flags, the Roma Benchmarking CLI includes command-line flags to specify the path to the UDF
to be benchmarked, the path to a json file to be supplied to the UDF as input, and the RPC to execute.

Run with:
```
docker load -i tools/benchmark-cli.tar
docker run \
  --privileged \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --volume /absolute/path/my_udfs:/udf \
  privacy-sandbox/sample-byob-sdk/roma-byob/benchmark:v1 \
  <flags>
```

## Flags

| Flag        | Description                                   |

| `--udf`     | the UDF executable to be benchmarked          |
